Located at Bellevue Hospital since 2009, the Department of Plastic Surgery Administrative Suite occupies a wing of the historic “A Building” at Bellevue Hospital. Central offices for the Chair and Administrator of the Department, as well as the Bellevue Hospital Service Chief and surgeons with their support staff, provide a central location for all of the administrative functions of the Department. There is also a multimedia conference room for committee and other meetings.

Carle Foundation Hospital is the primary teaching hospital for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign College of Medicine. Carle Clinic and Carle Foundation recently merged which created the need to design a suite of executive offices that combines senior leadership, administrative and operations functions of the two entities on two floors of their exiting north building. 

LCM studied several options before arriving at the selected plan. The final design incorporates materials and finishes that complement other areas of the hospital while creating an environment that enhances collegiality and greatly facilitates the work of Carle Foundation Hospital’s executive team.
